            <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
            <p>erry is a handsome male Beagle. He is very healthy, active, friendly, cheeky, and intelligent. He is a typical Beagle in some of his behaviours but completely different in others. Jerry has pet modelling experience & loves posing in front of the camera and is an extremely photogenic boy. He is a very lively fun-loving boy who is an ideal pet talent for a variety of roles.

            This handsome pet knows all agility training including going through tunnels and weaving through poles and taking direction well and from a distance. He also has the ability to learn a sequence of commands, enjoys training, and picks things up easily. New tricks aren’t hard for him to learn and he’s always up for learning something new. This clever little dog can respond to commands via voice and hand signals and also work with props with no issues.</p>
